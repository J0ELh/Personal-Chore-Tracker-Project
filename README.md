## Chore Tracker

Functionality Description:

*I want to design an application* that allows users to fairly distribute chores in a household and track the completion
of these chores. Ideally the application could distribute chores based on difficulty
of completing chores. The application would semi-randomly assign people chores based on difficulty,
so that everyone in the household would do their fair share of work.
*This application is to be used by a member of a household* who prefers
a simpler way of ensuring work gets done in the house. Everyone in the household
would benefit from having more transparency of what tasks are to be done and which people
are not doing their fair share of work.

*I am interested in developing this application,* since I believe
that a big reason for conflict in the household is a lack of transparency. If all
members of a household knew how much work everyone else was doing, they would feel responsibility
to do their fair share. The application would also prevent members of a household from feeling
discouraged for doing "all the work" since the application would **show how much others are contributing** and ideally
also **reward those** who always complete their chores by giving them easier work in the future.
